## The Origin Story: December 2020

### The Project Background

In Fall 2020, Wake Forest University's Master of Science in Management (MSM) program partnered with **E. & J. Gallo Winery** for a semester-long **Graduate Consulting Project (GCP)**. Sponsored by Gallo's Winston & Salem Houses (Sales and Marketing departments), the project challenged student teams to address a critical business question:

> **"With the increase in spiked seltzer trends, consumers (mainly Millennials and Generation Z) are drinking less wine and/or spirits. How should Gallo handle this shift?"**

Gallo had recently launched **Barefoot Seltzer**, the **only wine-based seltzer product currently in the market**, and sought actionable insights on two key challenges:

1. **Competitive Positioning:** How can Barefoot Seltzer compete with category leaders like White Claw and Truly in attracting Millennial/Gen Z consumers?
2. **Channel Strategy:** How can Gallo capitalize on the growth in the convenience channel to maximize Barefoot Seltzer sales?

Student teams conducted comprehensive market research, consumer analysis, and sales data evaluation to propose strategies for expanding Gallo's market share and strengthening its presence in the rapidly growing seltzer category.

The competition concluded in **December 2020** with final presentations, during which student teams delivered their recommendations—including both incremental changes Gallo could immediately implement and innovative solutions aimed at capturing the next generation of beverage consumers.

## Our Team's Approach

### Why Focus on China?

Our team (**Group 25**) chose a bold, differentiated strategy: instead of competing directly with White Claw and Truly in the saturated North American market, we proposed **entering the Chinese market** as a first-mover opportunity.

**The North American Context (2020):**
- Hard seltzers were exploding: growing at 200-300% annually
- Market size: ~$4-5 billion and rapidly expanding
- White Claw dominated with ~60% market share
- Truly held ~25% share
- New entrants (Bud Light Seltzer, Bon & Viv, Corona) flooding in
- Competition was fierce and capital-intensive

**The China Opportunity (2020):**
- Emerging hard seltzer market with minimal competition
- Massive consumer base: 400+ million Millennials and Gen Z
- Growing interest in Western lifestyle and drinking culture
- E-commerce infrastructure enabling rapid product launches
- Local competitors (RIO, Horoyoi) focused on different positioning
- **First-mover advantage** potential

Our hypothesis: By entering China early with a premium, wine-based positioning, Barefoot could establish brand leadership before the market became crowded—avoiding the fierce North American competition.
