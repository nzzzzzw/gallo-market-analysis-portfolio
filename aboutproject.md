## The Origin Story: December 2020


In Fall 2020, Wake Forest University's Master of Science in Management (MSM) program partnered with **E. & J. Gallo Winery** for a semester-long **Graduate Consulting Project (GCP)**. 

**The Challenge:**  
> **"With the increase in spiked seltzer trends, consumers (mainly Millennials and Generation Z) are drinking less wine and/or spirits. How should Gallo handle this shift?"**


**Our Focus:**  
Gallo had launched **Barefoot Seltzer** (the only wine-based seltzer) and needed insights on:
1. **Competitive Positioning:** How to compete with the category leaders
2. **Channel Strategy:** How to maximize sales in the vartity channels

Student teams presented in December 2020, proposing both **actionable strategies** for immediate implementation and **innovative concepts** to capture the next generation of consumers.

## Our Team's Approach

### Why Focus on China?

Our team (**Group 25**) chose a differentiated strategy: instead of competing in the saturated North American market, we proposed **entering China as a first-mover**.

**North American Context (2020):**
- Hard seltzers growing 200-300% annually
- Market size: ~$4-5 billion
- White Claw: ~60% share | Truly: ~25% share
- Fierce competition with new entrants flooding in

**China Opportunity (2020):**
- Emerging market with minimal competition
- 400+ million Millennials and Gen Z consumers
- Strong e-commerce infrastructure
- Local brands (RIO, Horoyoi) differently positioned
- **First-mover advantage potential**

**Our Research Question:**

>**Can premium wine-based positioning enable Barefoot to capture early-mover advantage in China's emerging hard seltzer market?**
