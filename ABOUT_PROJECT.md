## The Origin Story: December 2020

### The Competition

In Fall 2020, Wake Forest University's Master of Science in Management (MSM) program partnered with **E. & J. Gallo Winery** for a semester-long market research case competition. Gallo, one of the world's largest wine producers, was watching Millennials and Gen Z consumers shift away from traditional wine and spirits toward a new category: **hard seltzers**.

The challenge was clear: *"How should Gallo respond to the spiked seltzer trend?"*

### Our Team's Approach

Our team (Group 25) chose to focus on **Barefoot Hard Seltzer's potential entry into the Chinese market**. At the time, hard seltzers were exploding in North America:
- White Claw dominated with ~60% market share
- The category was growing at 200-300% annually
- Brands like Truly, Bon & Viv, and Bud Light Seltzer were rushing in
- Total North American market: ~$4-5 billion

Meanwhile, China represented an untapped opportunity with a massive consumer base and growing interest in Western drinking culture.

### The Research

We designed and executed a comprehensive market research project:

**Primary Research:**
- **273 survey responses** from Chinese consumers aged 21-35
- Mix of current hard seltzer drinkers and potential consumers
- Questions covering taste preferences, packaging, pricing, purchasing channels
- Demographic and behavioral segmentation

**Secondary Research:**
- Industry reports on hard seltzer trends
- Competitor analysis (White Claw, Truly, local Chinese brands)
- Cultural factors affecting alcohol consumption in China
- E-commerce vs. retail channel dynamics

**Key Insights from 2020:**
- 72% preferred glass bottles (premium perception)
- Strong interest in fruit flavors, especially tropical
- E-commerce was critical for product discovery
- Wine-based positioning could differentiate in crowded market
- Target demographic: urban females, 25-35, middle-class

### Our Strategic Recommendations

We presented a **wine-based positioning strategy** for Barefoot Hard Seltzer:

1. **Unique Selling Proposition:** "Premium wine-based seltzer" (vs. malt-based competitors)
2. **Target Market:** Urban Chinese females, 25-35, health-conscious
3. **Distribution:** E-commerce first (Tmall, JD.com), followed by retail
4. **Pricing:** Premium positioning ($3-4 per can, 15% above competitors)
5. **Marketing:** "Light, elegant, sophisticated" - playing to wine heritage
6. **Projected Market Size:** $5 billion by 2025 in China

### The Victory

In December 2020, our team **won first place** in the Gallo Case Competition. 🏆

The judges praised our thorough consumer research, data-driven insights, and innovative wine-based positioning strategy. We believed we had found a winning formula: leverage Gallo's wine expertise to differentiate in a crowded market.

We were confident. We had the data. We had the strategy.

**We were also wrong about some critical assumptions.**

## Five Years Later: Why Revisit This Project?

### What Actually Happened (2020-2025)

As I prepared my data analyst portfolio in late 2025, I wondered: *"Were we right? Did our predictions hold up?"*

Here's what I discovered:

**North America Hard Seltzer Market (2025):**
- Market grew to **$12 billion** (we predicted ~$10-12B) ✅
- White Claw's share dropped to **50-52%** (we predicted ~60%) ✅
- **High Noon** (vodka-based) became the #1 spirit seltzer with 10-12% share
- **Barefoot Hard Seltzer** struggled with <2% market share ❌

**China Hard Seltzer Market (2025):**
- Market reached only **~$2 billion** (we predicted $5B) ❌
- Growth was slower than North America's trajectory
- Local brands (RIO, Horoyoi) dominated
- E-commerce represented 40%+ of sales ✅
- Wine-based seltzers showed no premium perception ❌

**The Critical Miss:**
Our core assumption—that wine-based positioning would be a differentiator—was fundamentally flawed. Consumer blind taste tests consistently showed that **people cannot distinguish alcohol bases** in flavored seltzers. The "wine advantage" we championed didn't matter to consumers at all.

Meanwhile, Gallo's **vodka-based High Noon** became a massive success by targeting Gen Z with aggressive pricing, multiple ABV options (4.5% and 8%), and "real fruit juice" positioning.

### Why This Matters for My Portfolio

Most data analyst portfolios showcase successful projects. **This one showcases both success and failure**, demonstrating:

1. **Intellectual Honesty:** Admitting when predictions were wrong
2. **Analytical Maturity:** Understanding that good data ≠ correct conclusions
3. **Growth Mindset:** Revisiting past work with fresh perspective
4. **Technical Evolution:** Rebuilding 2020 Excel analysis with Python/SQL/Tableau
5. **Critical Thinking:** Identifying flawed assumptions, not just calculation errors

In interviews, I can discuss not just technical skills, but how I:
- Validate assumptions before making recommendations
- Separate facts (data) from interpretations (strategy)
- Learn from mistakes systematically
- Apply statistical validation (MAPE methodology)

## What I Learned

### About Data Analysis

**Good Data ≠ Good Decisions**
- We had 273 survey responses (solid sample size)
- We had industry reports (credible sources)
- We had logical reasoning (wine = premium)
- **But we missed a critical assumption test:** Do consumers actually care about alcohol base?

**Lesson:** Always validate core assumptions, not just collect data around them.

**Stated Preferences ≠ Actual Behavior**
- 72% said they preferred glass bottles
- Yet cans dominate actual sales (convenience)
- Survey responses can mislead if not validated

**Lesson:** Look for revealed preferences (behavior) over stated preferences (surveys).

**External Validation is Critical**
- We should have looked at global wine-based seltzer performance
- Other wine-based seltzers were struggling worldwide in 2019-2020
- This pattern was observable but we didn't check

**Lesson:** Always benchmark against global trends, not just local data.

### About Growth

This project taught me that:
- Making mistakes with good intentions is part of learning
- Intellectual humility beats ego in the long run
- Revisiting past work objectively is uncomfortable but valuable
- Admitting "I was wrong" is a strength, not weakness
- Growth mindset = treating failures as data, not shame

### About Portfolio Building

**What Works:**
- Real business context (not Kaggle toy datasets)
- Clear before/after story (2020 → 2025)
- Quantified results (15% MAPE, $12B market, 50% share)
- Professional documentation (GitHub, markdown)
- Visual storytelling (Tableau dashboard)

**What Doesn't:**
- Hiding mistakes or cherry-picking successes
- Generic "I analyzed X dataset" without unique angle
- Technical skills without business insight
- Claiming skills you don't actually have
